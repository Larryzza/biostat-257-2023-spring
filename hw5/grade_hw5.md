### Overall Grade: 146/120

### Quality of report: 7/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

No, Submitted an hour and a half after deadine (-3)

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

Yes

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (Jupyter Notebook) for reproducibility?

Yes

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

Yes

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 100/70

- Q1 (10/10 pts). 

- Q2 (30/30 pts). Check correctness of code. Depending on the solvers, the answers may differ after a few decimal points. For E-optimal design, there can be multiple solutions which give the same optimal objective value.

- Q3 (30/30 pts). Check correctness of code. Different solvers can give different answers, some of them are even inferior solutions. As far as code is correct, that is fine.

- Q4 (30 bonus pts). Complete +30

### Usage of Git: 9/10

- Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch?
Yes
- Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 

No, only 3 commits (-1)
          
- Is the hw submission tagged? 
Yes
- Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
Yes
- Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control. 


### Reproducibility: 10/10

- Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? 
Yes
- If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?
N/A
### Julia code style: 20/20

- Rule (4). Four space indenting rule. 

- Rule (6). 80 charcter rule.
